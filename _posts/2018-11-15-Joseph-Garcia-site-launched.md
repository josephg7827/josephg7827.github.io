This week in AP computer science we learned about tables and charts. More importantly we learned how to find trends within those charts. For example we found trends in our animal chart in google sheets. We were asked to observe patterns in this chart like number of legs age and weight. We were also asked to make a question and find out if what type of question it was. One of my groups questions was "What species got adopted faster(in weeks)? We said this question was an analysis question because we had to compare data it was not a question that could be determined by just looking at the chart.
