This week we learned how to code on pyret which is a python inspired coding website where you can create whatever you want our first day we started learning how to make simple shapes and we learned the code to make circles, squares, rectangles, etc now on our last day of week we are now making flags inspired from the flags of the world the first flag I chose is the japan flag because its a good start later I will try to do something more advanced than that.
